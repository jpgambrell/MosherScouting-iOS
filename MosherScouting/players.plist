		<key>summary</key>
		<string>In Dak Prescott&apos;s second-year as the Cowboys&apos; quarterback, he took a few steps backwards as more of the offense was put on his plate. He struggled when Ezekiel Elliott and/or Tyron Smith was out of the lineup and played like a much different quarterback in the second half of the season. Prescott threw more interceptions and saw his completion percentage dip in 2017. Entering his third season, it will be interesting to see what quarterback emerges; the rookie of the year one from 2016 or the inconsistent version we saw in in 2017? 2018 will be a make-or-break year for Prescott. </string>

		<key>summary</key>
		<string>As an undrafted free agent, Cooper Rush not only made the Cowboys&apos; roster, but he beat out Scott Linehan&apos;s favorite player of all-time; Kellen Moore. After a marvelous preseason, Rush became the Cowboys&apos; backup quarterback halfway through the year. Rush lacks the physical tools to ever be a full-time starter, but he is more than capable of being a quality backup in the NFL. Rush&apos;s poise, confidence and accuracy will allow him to stay in the league for many years. He is the ideal backup in today&apos;s NFL that emphasizes the short-passing game.  He will compete with rookie Mike White for his job. </string>

		<string>The Cowboys selected Mike White in the fifth-round of the 2018 Draft to give them a developmental quarterback behind Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush. White has all the tools to be a starting quarterback in the NFL with impressive size, arm strength and football intelligence. His biggest weakness is his lack of mobility, which often causes him to take too many sacks. In the NFL, he&apos;s likely going to be blitzed often as teams know he can&apos;t get out of the pocket. However, his quick release and accuracy should allow him to counter pressure. White should at least developed into a backup quarterback in the NFL. </string>

		<string>Ezekiel Elliott is the perfect three-down back for today&apos;s NFL. Elliott has the speed to break off long runs when given lanes and the power and leg drive to punish defenders in short-yardage situations. He also has the vision and patience to run in any scheme, including man and wide-zone concepts. His career in the NFL might not be for long as he is one of the most violent runners in the league. But as of right now, there is no other player that can match his toughness and physical gifts. He&apos;s the best running back in the league and it is not even close.  With his suspension now in the past, we might see a new Elliott in 2018.</string>

		<string>52/100 - Quality Backup</string>
		<key>summary</key>
		<string>Rod Smith has had an interesting journey to the NFL so far. After being kicked out of Ohio State and being released by the Seattle Seahawks, Smith found himself on the Cowboys&apos; roster in 2015. In 2016, the Cowboys moved him to fullback and he bounced on and off the roster. But in 2017, Smith found himself back at running back and thrived in the second half of the season. Smith scored five touchdowns as he helped fill in during Ezekiel Elliott&apos;s absence. Smith will likely never be a starter in the NFL, but his ability to run, block and catch make him the ideal backup in today&apos;s NFL. </string>

		<key>summary</key>
		<string>For years, the Cowboys have experimented with the idea of an &quot;offense weapon&quot; who can make plays out of the backfield as a runner and as a receiver. They have tried and failed with Lance Dunbar, Lucky Whitehead and most recently, Ryan Switzer. Instead of chasing the Tavon Austin&apos;s of the world, they decided to get the man himself. Austin won&apos;t be used as a traditional running back or as a receiver, but the team will use his speed to create mismatches, while hopefully freeing up the Ezekiel Elliott inside. Austin should see heavy snaps on special teams as well as out of the backfield. </string>

		<string>If it wasn&apos;t for multiple lower body injuries (broken ankle in 2010, torn ACL in 2011, torn ACL in 2015, broken right leg in 2017), Scarbrough&apos;s talent suggest he could have been a top-100 selection. However, he fell to the 7th round due to his injury concerns. When healthy, Scarbrough is a force on the ground. He runs with power inside between the tackles, but he is nearly impossible to stop once he gets to the outside. His speed and strength make him difficult for defensive backs to bring down. In Dallas, he will compete for a roster spot as the team&apos;s No.3 running back. There is some potential here.  </string>

		<string>After being undrafted in 2015, Trey Williams is now on his sixth-NFL team (and one CFL team) in four seasons. In fact, this is his second stint with the Cowboys after signing with them the first time in November of 2015. Williams has just two career touches in the NFL and this might be his last shot to make it in the NFL. In order for Williams to make the roster, he will need to beat out Tavon Austin and Bo Scarbrough as the team&apos;s third running back. To do so, he is going to need to show that he can contribute on special teams and as a pass-blocker. If he can&apos;t, then expect him to be out after training camp. </string>

		<string>Jamize Olawale began his career with the Dallas Cowboys after signing with the team as an undrafted free agent. However, Olawale was eventually released and signed with the Oakland Raiders, where played in 77 games over six seasons. After losing Keith Smith to Oakland, Dallas traded for Olawale to fill their vacant fullback position. Olawale isn&apos;t a great blocker, but he is an athletic rusher/receiver who makes much more sense in a pass-heavy offense. Despite being just an average blocker, don&apos;t be surprised if he ends up playing more H-back and TE snaps this season due to the loss of Witten. </string>

		<string>After a 1,000-yard, 10 touchdown season in 2015, Allen Hurns fell out of favor in Jacksonville as he failed to reach 500 yards in each of the past two seasons. Hurns was released by the Jaguars in March as they wanted to add more speed to the offense. Hurns isn&apos;t a dynamic player, but is just the type of receiver the Cowboys&apos; offense was missing in 2017. Hurns is a versatile receiver who thrives when he is used out of the slot in the middle of the field. Ideally, you want to play him opposite of a player with speed, but he should be just fine in the Cowboys&apos; ball-control offense that uses a ton of short passing. He is a good WR2. </string>

		<string>With the 81st pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys selected wide receiver Michael Gallup from Colorado State. Gallup doesn&apos;t project as a No.1 receiver in the NFL, but he has all of the tools and ability to be a high-end No.2 Gallup may not start right away, but his ability to play multiple spots at a high level should allow him to get on the field some in his rookie season. Gallup&apos;s best trait is his competitiveness and it is evident in his ability to make plays after the catch. He needs to improve his route running, but if he hits his ceiling, Dallas could be getting a Michael Thomas-type of player.  </string>

		<string>After a career year in 2016 in which he caught 75 passes for 833 yards, Cole Beasley had one of his worst years of his career. Defenses game-planned to stop him by sitting on the shorter routes and/or double teaming him. Beasley wasn&apos;t able to beat defenses deep and the Cowboys&apos; offense struggled converting third downs. 2018 is a big year for Beasley as he has just one year left on his current. Beasley is still a good slot receiver , but if he doesn&apos;t produce early in 2018, look for this to be his last year in Dallas. With the Cowboys relying more on quick timing passes, 2018 could be a big year for Beasley.  </string>

		<string>Despite drafting Michael Gallup in the third round and trading for Tavon Austin, the Cowboys still decided to use a sixth-round choice on wide receiver Cedrick Wilson.  His strength as a player is his ability to make plays down the field. While he doesn&apos;t have great speed, he tracks the ball so well and shields defenders from the ball. He will likely battle with Deonte Thompson for a roster spot as the team&apos;s big play receiver. For the sake of Wilson&apos;s career, he needs time to get stronger as veteran cornerbacks can often re-route him with ease. He has some talent, but he is still a work-in-progress. </string>

		<string>Deonte Thompson was the first receiver the Cowboys signed this offseason and his fit will be interesting. Of all the receivers in the room, he has by far the most speed. However, he lacks the ability to do much else besides make plays down the field. Ideally, the Cowboys will be able to use him in a reserve role, similar to what they did last year with Brice Butler. Thompson joins a crowded receiver room and being a somewhat limited player, he will need a big training camp and preseason to justify his contract and a spot on the active roster. Thompson will have to produce on special teams to stick. </string>

		<string>Despite being a seventh-round pick, Noah Brown found his way onto the Cowboys&apos; roster and onto the field frequently as a rookie. Brown played 161 snaps on offense and found ways to contribute on special teams as well. Brown lacks the overall athleticism to be a No.1 or No.2 receiver in the NFL, but his size, hands and blocking ability will allow him to become a productive player. Brown&apos;s best role in the NFL might come as an H-back or Tight End who can beat linebackers in the middle of the field with his speed, but also hold up in the run game. Brown is a nice role player to have at the bottom of any roster. </string>

		<string>It was a rough first year in the NFL for K.D. Cannon. He left Baylor early to enter the NFL Draft, but was not selected. He was signed after the draft by the 49ers, but was cut less than two weeks later. Cannon was signed and released by two other teams before eventually ending up on the Cowboys&apos; practice squad. Cannon has talent and the speed that this team covets, but he just doesn&apos;t do enough on offense or on special teams to warrant a roster spot. Ideally, Cannon improves his route running on a practice squad in 2018 and then tries to catch on somewhere by 2019. Don&apos;t be surprised if he is cut early in camp. </string>

		<string>After being a 7th-round selection by the Cowboys in 2015, Geoff Swaim has improved each year, specifically as a blocker. Swaim is just an average athlete, but he is at his best as a receiver when he can make plays after the catch. He needs to continue to improve and expand his route tree, but with just a little bit of seasoning, Swaim could become a solid second tight end for this team. As of now, he&apos;s an average backup who gives the team depth and a player who can play on every special teams unit. Ideally, the Cowboys would like to keep Swaim as the third tight end on the roster. </string>

		<string>Rico Gathers is a former basketball player who has failed to appear in a game in two seasons with the Cowboys. However, his upside is immense. In the preseason, Gathers showed why the Cowboys are willing to gamble on his talent. Gathers dominated in the short time he was on the field, as he was just bigger and more athletic than the defenders guarding him. He is incredibly raw from a technical standpoint, but his physical skill-set is just too much to handle for defenses. Assuming he is healthy and is willing to work on his craft, there is no reason Gathers shouldn&apos;t see the field in 2018 as a part-time receiver, at worst.</string>

		<string>In 2017, rookie tight end Blake Jarwin played just four offensive snaps this season, but the Cowboys love his talent and upside as a blocking tight end. However, he has the ability to play all over the field and contributor as a blocker and as a receiver. Jarwin was called up to the active roster from the practice squad during in the middle of the season as teams were trying to add him to their 53-man squads. Jarwin doesn&apos;t have the ceiling to be an every-down tight end in the NFL, but he is more than capable of becoming a No.2 or No.3 tight end with more playing time. However, he might be TE1 in 2018 for Dallas.  </string>

		<string>Fourth-round pick Dalton Schultz was drafted for one reason; his blocking ability. While he doesn&apos;t have overwhelming power or functional strength, it&apos;s his versatility that makes him a valuable NFL player. At Stanford, he was used all over the field as a blocker, taking snaps on the line of scrimmage, in the slot, out wide and even in the backfield. In Dallas, Schultz will likely be  taking over James Hanna&apos;s role as the team&apos;s move tight end. Expect Shultz to primarily be used as an H-back early on, with the potential for him to earn the No.2 job down the road. He needs a ton of work, but his game fits the Cowboys&apos; scheme. </string>

		<string>After the 2018 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys signed free agent tight end David Wells from San Diego State. In school, Wells was used as a blocking specialist who never received much action in the passing game. He had just 38 career receptions despite playing in 52 career games. While he has the size that Dallas typically wants from their tight ends, his overall lack of athleticism and rawness as a blocker will likely keep him off the 2018 roster, as of now. However, he might be the perfect practice squad tight end to develop in case Geoff Swaim or Blake Jarwin go down during the regular season. </string>

		<string>When Tyron Smith is healthy, there isn&apos;t a better offensive linemen in the entire league. His ability to win with technique, athleticism and power are rare. He could play any position on the offensive line and be an instant All-Pro player. However, injuries have limited him some over the past two years and the Cowboys (more specifically, Dak Prescott) struggled in his absence. The Cowboys ask him to do so much on every play and without him in the lineup, the offense fell to levels this franchise has never seen before. He should be healthy entering 2018 and this team needs him to return to his elite level to be successful. </string>

		<string>In 2016, Chaz Green was brilliant  when he was asked to fill in for Tyron Smith. But in 2017, Green struggled both as a left tackle and has a left guard. His performance against the Falcons will be one that haunts him and follows him for the rest of his career. However, if the Cowboys decided to let Green  play only at tackle, it wouldn&apos;t be that surprising  to see him get back to that 2016 level. He clearly has the athleticism and size to be a starting tackle in the NFL. Green enters the final year of his rookie deal this season and the Cowboys need to find out if he can be their swing tackle sooner rather than later. </string>

		<string>If it wasn&apos;t for a sprained MCL and PCL in 2017, Connor Williams might have been the Cowboys&apos; first round selection. Williams was a highly thought of player at Texas as he was a consensus All-American as a 19-year old sophomore.  His lack of length suggests that he may only be able to play guard in the NFL, but he is an outstanding athlete who has enough power to survive at tackle. In Dallas, Williams will play guard and that suits his skill-set well. He needs to improve his hand-technique and it may take time for him to adjust to his new position, but Williams has Pro-Bowl potential at left guard.  </string>

		<string>For the third season in a row, Travis Frederick has been the best center in the league. His overwhelming power, hand technique and ability to get to the second level make him the best zone-blocking center we have seen in some time. He needs to cut back on the penalties and speed tends to give him problems at times, but other than that, there are very few weaknesses in his game. As long as Travis Frederick and Zack Martin can stay healthy, the Cowboys will have the best, most versatile interior offensive line in the entire NFL.  Frederick might be the most consistent of all the Cowboys&apos; offensive linemen.</string>

		<string>Once again, it was another All-Pro caliber year for Zack Martin. Ever since he walked onto the field in 2014 for the Cowboys, he has been their most consistent offensive linemen. Martin doesn&apos;t have elite size or measurables,  but he is technically sound in all areas of the game. Better yet, he has some &quot;nasty&quot; to him and plays to the echo of the whistle. Martin doesn&apos;t have a flaw and has yet to miss a game in his four-year career in the NFL. Martin is the best guard in all of football and could be a Pro-Bowl tackle if he wanted to. Assuming he stays healthy, he will continue to make the Pro Bowl each year for the next decade.</string>

		<string>Marcus Martin was a third-round pick by the San Francisco 49ers in 2014, but he was released after the 2016 season. Martin signed with the Cleveland Browns last year, but failed to appear in a game. The Cowboys signed Martin this offseason after losing Jonathan Cooper in free agency. Martin won&apos;t ever be the &quot;first&quot; option at guard, but his experience at guard and center will likely keep him active on game day. If Martin is inserted into the lineup, he will be the clear weak-link of the unit, but with multiple All-Pro offensive linemen on the roster, he&apos;s good enough to get them through drives and games. </string>

		<string>After making the switch from left guard to right tackle, La&apos;el Collins had an up-and-down year. Collins allowed 51 pressures in 2017, the fifth-most of any tackle. However, he only allowed five sacks despite facing a murder&apos;s row of pass rushers. As the season went on, Collins&apos; game improved as he settled into the position. He will likely always struggle with speed, but with his power and aggressiveness, Collins has all the tools to be an elite right tackle in today&apos;s NFL. However, if he struggles this season, Dallas would always have the ability to move him back to guard and swing Connor Williams out to tackle.</string>

		<string>After four seasons in New England, the Cowboys signed Cameron Fleming to a team-friendly one-year deal. After the struggles with Chaz Green and Byron Bell in 2017, the team didn&apos;t want to be left high-and-dry again at tackle. Fleming isn&apos;t a great player, but he does have experience at guard and at tackle. He is a very poor athlete, but to his credit, he has improved in each of the past four seasons and became an every-week starter for the Patriots by the end of the year. Fleming is a nice fit as a sixcth-offensive linemen, but probably won&apos;t develop into a long-term starter here in Dallas. Fleming is an upgrade over Green. </string>

		<string>Over the past two seasons, Joe Looney has played 397 snaps as the team&apos;s backup swing guard/center. He isn&apos;t an impressive athlete by any means, but his versatility, professionalism and experience have allowed him to stick in the NFL. Looney was re-signed by the Cowboys in the later stages of free agency not to compete for a spot, but to help out any younger players who may be battling for a starting  role. However, if the Cowboys decide to keep Marcus Martin as the swing guard this season, Looney could be in danger of losing his spot. He shouldn&apos;t be considered a lock to make the 53-man roster.</string>

		<string>Despite entering the league in 2015 as a fifth-round pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Kadeem Edwards has failed to appear in a single game in his NFL career. Edwards was released by the Buccaneers and Jaguars before ending up on the Cowboys&apos; practice squad in 2016. Edwards as adequate size and athleticism, but lacks refinement in all areas of his game. While he could be classified as a developmental offensive linemen, at the age of 27, his time is running out in the NFL. If he doesn&apos;t show major improvement during training camp, this will likely be his last shot at making it in the league. </string>

		<string>Jake Campos was signed by the Dallas Cowboys after the 2018 NFL Draft as an undrafted free agent. Much like 2017 signing Dan Skipper, Campos is a massive tackle with a ton of experience in the Big 12. Campos started 33 career games at left tackle and three more at right tackle as a redshirt freshmen. He was highly sought after coming out of high school, but dealt with a few different injuries that caused him to miss time. Campos is a bad athlete who may not be able to handle NFL speed and he doesn&apos;t have the length to make up for his lack of quickness. He is a practice squad candidate for 2018. </string>

		<string>After a disappointing 2016 season in which he recorded just one sack, Demarcus Lawrence bounced back in a major way in 2017. Lawrence led the league in pressures last season and went on to become one of the league&apos;s most fearsome pass rushers. At just 26-years old, Lawrence is just starting to reach his prime after foot and back injuries limited him in two of his first four seasons. As long as Lawrence is healthy, there are few pass rushers in the league that are more well-rounded players than him at the position. He is an elite player who should only get better under defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli. </string>

		<string>Taco Charlton&apos;s rookie year was rough to say the least. The team put him in a bad position to start the year as they played him as a right defensive end and he just doesn&apos;t have the athleticism to win from that spot. But once he moved back to the left side, he was able to find success in the second half of the season. Charlton showed flashes of promise throughout the year, but they were often few and far between. In 2018, Charlton will primarily be Demarcus Lawrence&apos;s backup at left defensive end, who might be able to kick inside in certain situations. Expect a much more consistent player in his second season. </string>

		<string>Tyrone Crawford has had a fascinating career in Dallas. He was drafted to be a 3-4 defensive end. Then he was moved to a 4-3 three-technique in Rod Marinelli&apos;s defense and played well enough to earn a massive contract extension. Then, in 2016, he played most of the season as a 4-3 left defensive end. But in 2017, he operated mostly as the team&apos;s right defensive end. Crawford will never get enough credit for the job he does for this team as he has been solid at every position he has played. Crawford can be an average to an above-average player at multiple positions across the defensive line. </string>

		<string>Since being drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 2015, Randy Gregory has appeared in just 14 total games and has recorded just one career sack. However, when he is on the field, he is easily one of the most talented players on the entire defense. Gregory has every trait that you want from an elite edge rusher and if he is eligible to play in 2018, there is no doubt he will be in the team&apos;s starting lineup. He is one of the most naturally gifted pass rushers in the entire league and has the ability to be a double-digit sack guy in the NFL, provided he stays on the field. </string>

		<string>After being selected a few picks after DeMarcus Lawrence in 2014, Kony Ealy is now on his fourth team in five seasons. Ealy has just five sacks over the past three years, but his performance in the Super Bowl in 2015 showed what kind of potential he has. Ealy is a high-upside, roll-of-the-dice gamble that Will McClay and Rod Marinelli like to bet on. It wouldn&apos;t be shocking if he finds himself in the Cowboys&apos; defensive line rotation right away in 2018.  However, he&apos;s not guaranteed a roster spot, either. Ealy shouldn&apos;t be relied on to be a starting defensive end in the NFL, but he is a quality No.3 or No.4 edge rusher. </string>

Tapper has a ton of athletic potential and his ceiling is very high, but he has had a hard time staying healthy and it has hurt his development. Entering Year 3, Tapper is in for a critical season with the Cowboys. He isn&apos;t a lock to make the roster, but could easily find himself on the outside looking in if he doesn&apos;t have a big camp. However, don&apos;t be surprised if he makes big strides this year and finds himself in the defensive end rotation.  </string>

		<string>On the surface, it didn&apos;t appear the Cowboys needed to draft another defensive end, at least not early on. But when Dorance Armstrong fell to them in the fourth-round, it was an easy decision. Armstrong is a highly productive, team-captain who is very young (20). His long arms and wingspan fit into the prototype that Dallas wants on the edge. Armstrong needs some development with his hand usage and needs a full year in an NFL weight program, but under Rod Marinelli, Armstrong could develop into a solid rotational player, at worst. Don&apos;t be surprised if Armstrong finds the field as a rookie.</string>

		<string>James Hearns is a productive pass-rusher out of Louisville who signed with the Cowboys after the 2018 NFL Draft as an undrafted free agent. In college, Hearns played all over the field, but his best work came as a stand-up 3-4 linebacker who could hustle his way to the ball. However, the odds of Hearns making it in the NFL are quite low given his advanced age (will turn 25 during this season), his lack of athleticism and his lack of size. But he is a player who just always seems to be around the football and is in the right place at the right time. Don&apos;t be surprised if he makes a bunch of plays throughout the pre-season. </string>

		<string>After a fantastic rookie season, Maliek Collins had a down year in 2017. But it wasn&apos;t all his fault. In 2016, Collins primarily played the 3-technique and recorded five sacks at age 21. Last year, Collins was moved around and settled in as the team&apos;s 1-technique as David Irving occupied the 3-technique. Collins&apos; struggled as he just doesn&apos;t have the frame to play the position as double teams often moved him off of his spot. While Collins is a much better fit as a 3-technique, he might not be dominant enough to hold down that job in Dallas. However, he  broke his foot in May and could be out in the end of August. </string>

		<string>Datone Jones spent the first part of the year with the 49ers before landing in Dallas in late November. Jones is an undersized defensive tackle who has struggled to find a home in the NFL. He doesn&apos;t have the athleticism or hand technique to win on the edge and his lack of size hurts him on the inside. In Dallas, Rod Marinelli found him a home as a 1-technique. Jones is the ideal rotational defensive linemen for Marinelli as his motor runs hot all the time and he can get up the field with his quickness. Jones isn&apos;t a star, but he is a quality depth player who can give this team 10-15 quality snaps at multiple positions.</string>

		<string>In one of the team&apos;s most controversial moves of the offseason, the Cowboys traded 2017 fourth-round pick Ryan Switzer for defensive tackle Jihad Ward from Oakland. In two years with the Raiders, Ward recorded just one sack and 32 total tackles. He was a massive bust for the 44th overall player in the 2016 Draft. However, this is a player that Rod Marinelli coached at the Senior Bowl and fell in love due to his strong hands and high-motor. He is still somewhat of a project and it&apos;s unclear how he may factor into this defensive line, but don&apos;t count out Marinelli working some of his magic here. </string>

		<key>summary</key>
		<string>Daniel Ross is a big-bodied defensive tackle who signed with the Houston Texans after the 2017 draft. Ross bounced around the league before Dallas signed him to the team&apos;s active roster after spending the first half of the season in Kansas City. Ross appeared in three games for Dallas, with his only sack happening in  Week 17 on a play in which the Eagles&apos; third string quarterback slipped and fell. Ross doesn&apos;t have a ton of athletic ability, but he is a decent player to stash on a practice squad. Don&apos;t expect Ross to make the team&apos;s final 53-man roster, but he should play a bunch in the preseason. </string>

		<string>After the final round of cuts in 2017,the Cowboys claimed Brian Price off of waivers to replace their free agent bust Cedric Thornton at the 1-technique. Price played 150 defensive snaps for the Cowboys and found himself a role before being placed on injured reserve in November after suffering a knee injury. Price isn&apos;t a star, but he showed a lot of promise as a run defender in 2017. If he can come back healthy in 2018, he is good enough to deserve some situational snaps as a 1-technique. There is a lot to like about Price&apos;s game, but the ceiling here is probably just an average NFL starter. </string>

		<string>Lewis Neal was an undrafted free agent in 2017 out of LSU who signed with the Cowboys after the draft. Neal was mostly used as a defensive end in college, but transitioned to defensive tackle in the NFL. Neal was signed to the Cowboys&apos; practice squad and eventually found his way onto the active roster by November. Neal played in seven games as both a 1 and 3-technique, despite his limited size. Ultimately, Neal&apos;s best fit in the NFL will come as a penetrating 3-technqiue who can win his quickness and natural leverage. Neal could develop into a solid rotational player given time. </string>

		<string>Of all the defensive tackles on the roster, Richard Ash has the most size. Listed at 6&apos;3, 333 pounds, Ash looks more like a nose tackle than a traditional 1-techinque in Rod Marinelli&apos;s defense. While the Cowboys haven&apos;t added many names to their defensive tackle depth chart, it is still hard to find a spot for Ash on the team&apos;s 53-man roster. Even as just a run-defender, he is only average. Ash is a good player to stash on a practice squad and use in case of emergency, but other than that, he just doesn&apos;t offer much. Expect Ash to be on the outside looking in at the end of training camp.  </string>

		<string>Since moving to the weakside linebacker spot in 2015, Sean Lee has played at least 11 games in each of the last three seasons. He has missed time, but he&apos;s been able to stay on the field for the majority of the team&apos;s games. Aside from staying healthier, Lee has been fantastic on the weakside as it was his third straight season with at least 100 tackles and he played at an All-Pro level when on the field this year. In terms of just his on-the-field play, Lee has no real weakness, despite his injury history. There is nothing he can&apos;t do well. His play and availability will drive the Cowboys&apos; defense once again in 2018. </string>

		<string>The plan for Jaylon Smith in 2017 was to ease him into action as he missed all of the 2016 season with a knee injury that caused nerve damage. But once Anthony Hitchens went down in the preseason, Smith was forced into action. He struggled early in the season, but improved as the year went on and his snaps were limited.
At this point in his career, Smith is more of a straight-line athlete than he is fluid. Smith struggled as a run defender as he couldn&apos;t get off of blocks and was slow to react to what was developing ahead of him. The Cowboys need more from him in 2018 and expect him to deliver.</string>

		<string>With the team&apos;s first round pick in 2018, the Dallas Cowboys selected linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. Dallas had to improve the linebacker corps after it derailed their season in 2017. Vander Esch has the size of a middle linebacker, but his best spot might be on the weakside. Either way, Vander Esch figures to be on the field early as a rookie. But in order for him to take the next step as a player, he has to become more of a force when taking on blocks in the middle. Outside of that area, he is the perfect linebacker for today&apos;s NFL. His best production and play is still on the horizon. </string>

		<string>Joe Thomas started his career as an undrafted free agent of the Packers, in 2014, but he was signed to the Cowboys&apos; practice squad in 2015 before heading back to Green Bay.  Thomas doesn&apos;t have the size or take-on ability to be an every-down linebacker, but he does have the coverage ability to help out as a nickel or dime linebacker. In Dallas, Thomas will likely be the team&apos;s fourth or fifth linebacker who will cut his teeth on special teams. But if Dallas needs a guy to step in and give them some quality snaps in coverage, Thomas can do that. He is the ideal fifth linebacker for this team. </string>

		<string>Justin March-Lillard was an undrafted free agent after the 2015 draft and has bounced around the league since then. He eventually caught on with Dallas last year where he played in seven games. Most of March-Lillard&apos;s snaps came on special and that is likely what he will be asked to do again this year. His biggest competition for a roster spot will be between he and Joe Thomas. March-Lillard might be a guy the team stashes on the practice squad in case of injury. It&apos;s hard to envision him making the roster this year outside of his ability to play on special teams. </string>

		<string>In many ways, the 2017 season felt like a lost year for Damien Wilson despite playing 683 snaps. Wilson had a legal case that was held over his head during training camp and into the season and it seemed to affect his play. He didn&apos;t look like the same player we saw in 2016, despite settling in at the SAM linebacker position. Wilson is a core special teamer who has position flex, but he is entering a make-it or break-it season in Year 4. Can Wilson develop into anything more than just a reserve/part-time linebacker? His development this year will certainly be worth watching.  </string>

		<string>After losing Anthony Hitchens to free agency and Justin Durant to retirement, the Cowboys needed to add multiple linebackers this offseason. Indiana&apos;s Chris Covington was the second linebacker the Cowboys drafted in the 2018 class (Leighton Vander Esch). Covington is a young player who only started 13 career games at Indiana. But whenever he has played, he has been productive. His best spot in the NFL might be as a run-and-chase MLB, but to start his career, he is going to need to make the roster by playing special teams. Expect him to compete with Justin March-Lillard and Joe Thomas for a spot. </string>

		<string>In 2015 and 2016, Joel Lanning was Iowa State&apos;s starting quarterback, starting 14 games and playing in 23 total. Most of his work came as a runner (983 career rushing yards), but he also threw for 2,584 career yards and 20 touchdowns. As a senior, Lanning was moved to linebacker and produced at a very high level. Dallas signed him after the 2018 draft as an undrafted free agent and he will continue the transition  to linebacker in the NFL. However, given his size and his experience handling the ball, don&apos;t be surprised if he is the next &quot;Keith Smith&quot; and spends time at both linebacker and fullback for the Cowboys. </string>

		<string>Chidobe Awuzie&apos;s rookie season got off to a shaky start as he missed most of the preseason with a hamstring injury and then re-injured it again early in the season. But by the end of the year, Awuzie became the Cowboys&apos; best defensive back. He finished third on the team in pass deflections, despite playing in just 10 games. Awuzie has everything you would want in an outside cornerback, but also has the size to play safety in a pinch. He&apos;s fearless and his confidence is never an issue with him. Provided that he can stay healthy, Awuzie has a chance to be one of the better cornerbacks in the entire NFL. </string>

		<string>After a false accusation of domestic violence dropped him in the draft, the Cowboys stole Jourdan Lewis in the third round. He battled a hamstring injury that forced him to miss all of training camp and the first game of the regular season, but he went on to play 746 defensive snaps for the Cowboys. Most of Lewis&apos; snaps came as an outside cornerback and he held up well. However, his best spot in the NFL might be as a slot cornerback. Lewis will likely see some snaps as an outside cornerback this year, expect most of his time to be spent inside. He has a chance to be a star as a slot defender in 2018.</string>

		<string>After a fantastic second season, Byron Jones took a step back last year. Jones mostly played as a strong safety who covered tight ends, but he struggled against the run. Too often, he was out of position and he tended to shy away from contact. A move back to cornerback might be the ideal spot for Jones as he can use his athleticism and length to match up with bigger receivers. In Kris Richard&apos;s defense, Jones might be the perfect Cover-2/Cover-3 cornerback. The Cowboys decided to pick up Jones&apos; fifth-year option to give him more time to learn the position. Expect him to start as the right cornerback in Week 1. </string>

		<key>summary</key>
		<string>It was a rough second season for Anthony Brown.  He struggled versus press coverage and allowed a ton of separation in man coverage. Brown allowed a team-high 635 yards allowed in coverage. The Cowboys moved him to the outside and that was a mistake. He just doesn&apos;t have the strength to hold up at the position. Brown will likely go back to playing in the slot, but he will have to compete with Jourdan Lewis for snaps. Brown is an adequate No.3 or No.4 cornerback, but he needs to play in a scheme that limits how much man coverage he is in. Hopefully, Year 3 is better for Brown. </string>

		<string>Duke Thomas is an undrafted free agent who signed with the Houston Texans after the 2016 NFL Draft. He was eventually signed by the Dallas Cowboys in 2017 after being released by the Philadelphia Eagles. He has yet to appear in an NFL game. However, Thomas was impressive last season  during training camp and he went on to make a few nice plays in the preseason as well. The Cowboys have a lot of numbers at the cornerback position this season, but Thomas certainly has the ability to play in the NFL. He is going to need to beat out Marquez White and/or one of the UDFA CBs for a job in 2018. </string>

White has ideal size, but he just isn&apos;t a good enough athlete to start at the NFL level. However, he might find a role in Dallas as depth player who can contribute in zone coverage. White has a ton of playing experience and played in a bunch of big games at Florida State, but he probably just doesn&apos;t have the ceiling to be anything more than a No.4 or No.5 cornerback in the NFL. He will likely be competing with Duke Thomas and others for a roster spot on the 53-man roster. </string>

		<string>Kameron Kelly is the perfect Kris Richard cornerback. He is big, long and physical. He isn&apos;t afraid to stick his nose in run support and will try to out-muscle receivers at the line of scrimmage. His lack of long speed (4.66 at the NFL Combine) could keep him from being a starter in the NFL, but he is a guy that is going to be tough to keep off of the roster due to how hard he plays. Kelly will be in a battle with Duke Thomas and Marquez White for the final spot on the roster. Don&apos;t be surprised if he makes the team due to his ability to play cornerback, strong and free safety in the NFL. </string>

		<string>Charvarius Ward was signed by the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2018 out of Middle Tennessee State. Ward started just 10 career game in school after playing at a community college in his first two years of school.  Ward had a puzzling pro-day as his runs and jumps were all elite for a player of his size. But his poor shuttle and cone-drills dropped him down to just an 8th percentile athlete, according to 3sigmaathlete. Does Ward have the agility to play man-coverage in the NFL? That will be something that we find out very quickly in camp. If he  proves that he can, he may win a job on the 53-man roster. </string>

		<string>Jeff Heath was the butt of many jokes after the 2013 season, especially after the game in which the Cowboys allowed Calvin Johnson to go for 329 yards. However, Heath has developed into a good safety, who has also been a core special teamer. Heath is still relatively young (27) and still has a lot of upside that has to be unlocked. Heath&apos;s best spot on this roster is as a centerfielder, where he can use his athleticism to make plays on the ball. However, his lack of physicality makes him a weakness in the run game. Ideally, he is a team&apos;s third safety who can come in on nickel situations. He is a solid player.</string>

		<string>Xavier Woods was brilliant  for the Cowboys as a sixth-round rookie. Woods played a heavy dose of slot cornerback for the team as well as a strong safety. At times, he was used as a nickel linebacker and even as an edge defender. He was a core special teamer and did everything well. Ideally, he is a strong safety in the NFL, but he lacks the overall size to be an enforcer at that position. However, his feel for the game is outstanding and he is a player that you just want on the field, regardless of position. Expect more of the same from Woods in 2018  as he will likely see an increase in snaps as a box defender. </string>

		<string>In 2015, the Cowboys signed Jameill Showers as an undrafted free agent  from UTEP. Showers was a prolific college quarterback and the team decided to allow him to play there for the first two years of his career. In 2016, Showers played ahead of Dak Prescott in camp, but eventually was passed despite a solid preseason. Showers was eventually moved to strong safety, a position he has never played before. Showers played well on special teams in the preseason last year, but there is always some questions about what his ceiling might have been at quarterback. This is a crucial year in Showers&apos; NFL career. </string>

		<string>2017 was the best year of Chris Jones&apos; career as he was the most consistent punter in the league. Jones started off the year great by dominating the New York Giants as he placed multiple kicks inside the 5-yard line. But the most noteworthy play of Jones&apos; season came in Oakland where he took on an improvised fake put and ran 24 yards, flipping field position for the Cowboys. Jones and the rest of the Cowboys&apos; punt coverage unit allowed just 75 return yards in 2017, the fewest the league has seen since 2008. Jones was fantastic last season and gives the Cowboys a real weapon on special teams. </string>

		<string>There is only one word needed to describe L.P. Ladouceur&apos;s career in Dallas; flawless. Since signing with the Cowboys in 2005, Ladouceur has been perfect every snap in his career. He doesn&apos;t offer much in terms of position flex or in punt coverage, but he will tackle if he has to. He is getting up there in age and despite being perfect on every snap, the Cowboys might want to explore getting younger at the position in a few years. But as long as Ladouceur wants to keep playing, there is no reason he shouldn&apos;t be on the roster as he continues to be the best long snapper in the NFL. </string>
