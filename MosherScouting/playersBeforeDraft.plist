He struggled when Ezekiel Elliott and/or Tyron Smith was out of the lineup and played like a much different quarterback in the second half of the season. Prescott threw more interceptions and saw his completion percentage dip in 2017. Entering his third season, it will be interesting to see what quarterback emerges; the rookie of the year one from 2016 or the inconsistent version we saw in in 2017? 2018 will be a make-or-break year for Prescott.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#7 COOPER RUSH</string><key>position</key><string>QUARTERBACK</string><key>height</key><string>6'3</string><key>weight</key><string>228</string><key>birthdate</key><string>NOVEMBER 21, 1993 (24)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>33.3</string><key>stat2</key><string>2</string><key>stat3</key><string>0.7</string><key>stat4</key><string>0</string><key>stat5</key><string>0</string><key>stat6</key><string>42.4</string><key>stat7</key><string>0.9</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.93</string><key>hand size</key><string>9 1/8</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.72</string><key>bench press</key><string>N/A</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>27</string><key>broad jump</key><string>105</string><key>3 cone</key><string>7.23</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.47</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.241</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>37/40 - Below Average Backup</string><key>summary</key><string>As an undrafted free agent, Cooper Rush not only made the Cowboys' roster, but he beat out Scott Linehan's favorite player of all-time; Kellen Moore.

After being kicked out of Ohio State and being released by the Seattle Seahawks, Smith found himself on the Cowboys' roster in 2015. In 2016, the Cowboys moved him to fullback and he bounced on and off the roster. But in 2017, Smith found himself back at running back and thrived in the second  half of the season. Smith scored five touchdowns last season as he helped fill in during Ezekiel Elliott's absence. Smith will likely never be a starter in the NFL, but his ability to run, block and catch make him the ideal backup in today's NFL.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>JAMIZE OLAWALE</string><key>position</key><string>FULLBACK</string><key>height</key><string>6'1</string><key>weight</key><string>238</string><key>birthdate</key><string>APRIL 17, 1989 (29)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>9</string><key>stat2</key><string>43</string><key>stat3</key><string>4.8</string><key>stat4</key><string>1</string><key>stat5</key><string>6</string><key>stat6</key><string>33</string><key>stat7</key><string>0</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.53</string><key>hand size</key><string>N/A</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>N/A</string><key>bench press</key><string>N/A</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>N/A</string><key>broad jump</key><string>N/A</string><key>3 cone</key><string>N/A</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>N/A</string><key>sparq %</key><string>N/A</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>61/100 - Average Starter</string><key>summary</key><string>Jamize Olawale began his career with the Dallas Cowboys after signing with the team as an undrafted free agent. However, Olawale was eventually released and signed with the Oakland Raiders, where played in 77 games over six seasons. After losing Keith Smith to Oakland, Dallas traded for Olawale to fill their vacant fullback position. Olawale isn't a great blocker, but he is an athletic rusher/receiver who makes much more sense in a pass-heavy offense. Despite the trade, Olawale isn't a lock to make the roster due to the number of tight ends who perform just as well as a move blocker.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#88 DEZ BRYANT</string><key>position</key><string>WIDE RECEIVER</string><key>height</key><string>6'2</string><key>weight</key><string>225</string><key>birthdate</key><string>NOVEMBER 4, 1988 (29)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>132</string><key>stat2</key><string>69</string><key>stat3</key><string>838</string><key>stat4</key><string>12.1</string><key>stat5</key><string>6</string><key>stat6</key><string>266</string><key>stat7</key><string>11</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.52</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.58</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.51</string><key>bench press</key><string>N/A</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>38</string><key>broad jump</key><string>133</string><key>3 cone</key><string>7.21</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.48</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.44</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>73/100 - Good NFL Starter</string><key>summary</key><string>Dez Bryant's season paralleled Dak Prescott's season as he was productive in the first half of the season, but second half of the year turned into a diaster.

Hurns was released by the Jaguars in March as they wanted to add more speed to the offense. Hurns isn't a dynamic player, but is just the type of receiver the Cowboys' offense was missing in 2017. Hurns is a versatile receiver who thrives when he is used out of the slot in the middle of the field. Ideally, you want to play him opposite of a player with speed, but he should be just fine in the Cowboys' ball-control offense that uses a ton of short passing.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#83 TERRANCE WILLIAMS</string><key>position</key><string>WIDE RECEIVER</string><key>height</key><string>6'2</string><key>weight</key><string>208</string><key>birthdate</key><string>SEPTEMBER 8, 1989 (28)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>78</string><key>stat2</key><string>53</string><key>stat3</key><string>568</string><key>stat4</key><string>10.7</string><key>stat5</key><string>0</string><key>stat6</key><string>243</string><key>stat7</key><string>3</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.52</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.66</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.52</string><key>bench press</key><string>11</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>32.5</string><key>broad jump</key><string>119</string><key>3 cone</key><string>7.01</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.32</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.25</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>57/100 - Quality Backup</string><key>summary</key><string>EXCELLENT BLOCKER.

Instead, he carved out a role as an explosive punt returner who can change field positions at the drop of a hat.

He needs to continue to improve and expand his route tree, but with just a little bit of seasoning, Swaim could become a solid second tight end for this team. As of now, he's an average backup who gives the team depth and a player who can play on every special teams unit.

He is incredibly raw from a technical standpoint, but his physical skill-set is just too much to handle for defenses.

Expect a much more consistent player in his second season.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#95 DAVID IRVING</string><key>position</key><string>DEFENSIVE TACKLE</string><key>height</key><string>6'7</string><key>weight</key><string>273</string><key>birthdate</key><string>AUGUST 18, 1993 (24)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>22</string><key>stat2</key><string>9</string><key>stat3</key><string>7</string><key>stat4</key><string>1</string><key>stat5</key><string>16</string><key>stat6</key><string>10</string><key>stat7</key><string>6</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.84</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.82</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.69</string><key>bench press</key><string>13</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>38</string><key>broad jump</key><string>128</string><key>3 cone</key><string>7.27</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.52</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.911</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>80/100 - Pro Bowl Caliber</string><key>summary</key><string>STRONG HANDS.

Then, in 2016, he played most of the season as a 4-3 left defensive end. But in 2017, he operated mostly as the team's right defensive end. Crawford will never get enough credit for the job he does for this team as he has been solid at every position he has played.

His play and availablity will drive the Cowboys' defense once again in 2018.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#24 CHIDOBE AWUZIE</string><key>position</key><string>CORNERBACK</string><key>height</key><string>6'0</string><key>weight</key><string>202</string><key>birthdate</key><string>MAY 24, 1995 (23)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>309</string><key>stat2</key><string>25</string><key>stat3</key><string>1</string><key>stat4</key><string>7</string><key>stat5</key><string>1</string><key>stat6</key><string>2</string><key>stat7</key><string>117</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.43</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.57</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.53</string><key>bench press</key><string>16</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>34.5</string><key>broad jump</key><string>132</string><key>3 cone</key><string>6.81</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.14</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.977</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>74/100 - Good Starter</string><key>summary</key><string>Chidobe Awuzie's rookie season got off to a shaky start as he missed most of the preseason with a hamstring injury and then re-injured it early in the season. But by the end of the season, Awuzie became the Cowboys' best defensive back. He finished third on the team in pass deflections, despite playing in just 10 games. Awuzie has everything you would want in an outside cornerback, but also has the size to play safety in a pinch. He's fearless and confidence is never an issue with him. Provided that he can stay healthy, Awuzie has a chance to be one of the better cornerbacks in the entire NFL.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#27 JOURDAN LEWIS</string><key>position</key><string>CORNERBACK</string><key>height</key><string>5'10</string><key>weight</key><string>188</string><key>birthdate</key><string>AUGUST 31, 1995 (22)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>742</string><key>stat2</key><string>54</string><key>stat3</key><string>1</string><key>stat4</key><string>10</string><key>stat5</key><string>0</string><key>stat6</key><string>4</string><key>stat7</key><string>428</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.47</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.51</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.57</string><key>bench press</key><string>15</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>34.5</string><key>broad jump</key><string>121</string><key>3 cone</key><string>6.88</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.38</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.273</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>71/100 - Good Starter</string><key>summary</key><string>After a false accusation of domestic violence dropped him in the draft, the Cowboys stole Jourdan Lewis  in the third round. After battling a hamstring injury that forced him to miss all of training camp and the first game of the regular season, Lewis went on to play 746 defensive snaps for the Cowboys. Most of Lewis' snaps came as an outside cornerback and he held up well. However, his best spot in the NFL might be as a slot cornerback. Lewis will likely see some snaps as an outside cornerback this year, expect most of his time to be spent inside. He has a chance to be a star as a slot defender in 2018.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#31 BYRON JONES</string><key>position</key><string>DEFENSIVE BACK</string><key>height</key><string>6'1</string><key>weight</key><string>199</string><key>birthdate</key><string>SEPTEMBER 26, 1992 (26)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>905</string><key>stat2</key><string>71</string><key>stat3</key><string>1</string><key>stat4</key><string>5</string><key>stat5</key><string>1</string><key>stat6</key><string>6</string><key>stat7</key><string>447</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.43</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.52</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.5</string><key>bench press</key><string>18</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>44.5</string><key>broad jump</key><string>147</string><key>3 cone</key><string>6.78</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>3.94</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.9999</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>76/100 - Good Starter</string><key>summary</key><string>After a fantasic second season, Byron Jones took a step back last season. Jones mostly played as a strong safety who covered tight ends, but he struggled aganist the run. Too often, he was out of position and even when he was, he tended to shy away from contact. A move back to cornerback might be the ideal spot for Jones as he can use his athleticism and length to match up with bigger receivers. In Kris Richard's defense, Jones might be the perfect Cover-2/Cover-3 cornerback. 2018 is the final year of Jones' contract with the Cowboys and he will be looking to have a big year before hitting free agency.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#30 ANTHONY BROWN</string><key>position</key><string>CORNERBACK</string><key>height</key><string>5'11</string><key>weight</key><string>192</string><key>birthdate</key><string>DECEMBER 15, 1993 (24)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>843</string><key>stat2</key><string>54</string><key>stat3</key><string>2</string><key>stat4</key><string>11</string><key>stat5</key><string>1</string><key>stat6</key><string>7</string><key>stat7</key><string>635</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.33</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.55</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.55</string><key>bench press</key><string>19</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>35</string><key>broad jump</key><string>115</string><key>3 cone</key><string>7.03</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.19</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.401</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>51/100 - Quality Backup</string><key>summary</key><string>It was a rough second season for Anthony Brown.  He struggled versus press coverage  and allowed a ton of separation in man coverage.  Brown allowed a team-high 635 yards allowed in coverage. The Cowboys moved him to the outside and that was a mistake. He just doesn't have the strength to hold up at the position. Brown will likely go back to back to playing in the slot, but he will have to compete with Jourdan Lewis for snaps. Brown is an adequate No.3 or No.4 cornerback, but he needs to play in a scheme that limits how much man coverage he is in.  Hopefully, Year 3 is better for Brown.</string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#26 DUKE THOMAS</string><key>position</key><string>CORNERBACK</string><key>height</key><string>5'10</string><key>weight</key><string>184</string><key>birthdate</key><string>MAY 21, 1994 (24)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>0</string><key>stat2</key><string>0</string><key>stat3</key><string>0</string><key>stat4</key><string>0</string><key>stat5</key><string>0</string><key>stat6</key><string>0</string><key>stat7</key><string>0</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.41</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.57</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.56</string><key>bench press</key><string>17</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>34.5</string><key>broad jump</key><string>121</string><key>3 cone</key><string>6.73</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.21</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.493</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>DID NOT PLAY IN 2017</string><key>summary</key><string></string><key>film notes</key><string></string></dict><dict><key>name</key><string>#39 MARQUEZ WHITE</string><key>position</key><string>CORNERBACK</string><key>height</key><string>6'0</string><key>weight</key><string>194</string><key>birthdate</key><string>OCTOBER 29, 1994 (23)</string><key>college</key><string></string><key>mockdraftchart</key><string></string><key>stat1</key><string>0</string><key>stat2</key><string>0</string><key>stat3</key><string>0</string><key>stat4</key><string>0</string><key>stat5</key><string>0</string><key>stat6</key><string>0</string><key>stat7</key><string>0</string><key>40 yard dash</key><string>4.59</string><key>hand size</key><string>2.7</string><key>10 yard split</key><string>1.61</string><key>bench press</key><string>N/A</string><key>vertical jump</key><string>36</string><key>broad jump</key><string>123</string><key>3 cone</key><string>7.28</string><key>20 yard shuttle</key><string>4.36</string><key>sparq %</key><string>0.236</string><key>2017 grade</key><string>DID NOT PLAY IN 2017</string><key>summary</key><string>The Cowboys drafted Marquez White in the 6th round in 2017 and stashed him on the practice squad for the entire season.

White has a ton of playing experience and played in a bunch of big games at Florida State, but he probably just doesn't have the ceiling to be anything more than a No.4 or No.5 cornerback in the NFL.

Heath's best spot on this roster is as a centerfielder, where he can use his athleticism to make plays on the ball. However, his lack of physicality makes him a weakness in the run game.
